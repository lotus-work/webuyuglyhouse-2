        <h2>Sell your house to the buyer you can trust.</h2>
        <h3 class="mb-4">We Buy Houses Fast</h3>
        <p>When you try to sell your house to a local flipper, you may find an experienced pro with an acceptable
          reputation. Then again, you might end up with an absolute novice or unreputable person. These include people
          who attended a seminar or watched an HGTV show, and decided to "try their hand" at rehabbing a property. The
          results can be very frustrating.</p>
        <p>Local flippers are not bound by a common code of ethics. Some of them make offers and back out. Other
          companies that buy houses make an offer then ask you to make concessions for the repair and clean up. Many
          even encounter problems getting financing for a loan. Many novices even get cold feet in the middle of the
          transaction and simply walk away.</p>
        <p>You won’t encounter these issues with IBuyUglyHouses®. We make fair cash offers that won't be subject to hidden
          fees. There are no bank delays. And we all embrace the same standards: buying houses "as is" - that means no
          cleanup or repair needed. We can close in as little as 3 weeks or on your timeline (taking longer if you
          choose).</p>
        <p>A local flipper may seem eager to buy your house, but there are many potential pitfalls and headaches. When
          you want a fast, fair, all cash offer that you can really trust, call IBuyUglyHouses. We have the track record to
          prove it, just <a href="selling-your-house/reviews" target="_blank">read IBuyUglyHouses reviews.</a></p>
