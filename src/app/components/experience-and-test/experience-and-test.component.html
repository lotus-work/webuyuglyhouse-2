        <p>When you need or want to sell a house fast, things can get stressful, emotional, and sometimes frustrating.
          You can begin to think things like: </p>
        <p><i>"Has the real estate agent handled a situation like mine?"</i></p>
        <p><i>"Will I get the price they say I'll get?"</i></p>
        <p><i>"How long will I wait for this house to actually sell?"</i></p>
        <p>At IBuyUglyHouses®, we know the feeling. Since 2014, we’ve been helping homeowners every day escape these
          worries and more by purchasing houses "as is" for cash. Unlike other companies that buy houses, we buy houses
          in almost any condition. Having bought over 2,500 houses, we’ve seen it all and know how to handle every
          situation. </p>
        <p>You can trust our fair offer. We don’t charge commissions and pay typical closing costs. We are among the
          most trustworthy cash buyers of homes. Every month, hundreds of sellers trust us to get them cash quickly,
          sometimes in as little as 3 weeks. Plus, we are by your side every step of the way. </p>

        <p>Every day, homeowners trust us to make fast and fair cash offers—and we come through. We buy homes fast. We
          have long-lasting relationships with lenders, making financing easy. Our free, no-obligation consultations are
          held at your house so we can visit your property and possibly make a fair cash offer. </p>
        <p>We strive to provide a personalised, hassle-free process. Selling a house is a major life decision with many
          details, choices, and things to consider. When we’re working with seniors, we encourage them to have family
          members or friends join the conversation and ask questions during our visit and throughout every step along
          the way. We understand it’s important to have support and guidance from loved ones throughout the process.</p>
        <p>If the sale is complicated or if it makes the homeowner more comfortable, we’re also happy to include
          whatever type of advisor the seller wishes to have present so that we can answer any questions they might have
          at our initial meeting, or at any time during the sale. </p>

        <h2 class="mb-4">For a fast cash offer, who should you trust?</h2>

        <p>Other companies may call or email you with an instant offer to buy your house. Of course, they often lower
          their price once they actually see your home. They usually ask you to make concessions or pay for repairs. Why
          waste time with all that back and forth? Instead, you could work with us, <a href="https://realestate.usnews.com/real-estate/articles/what-you-need-to-know-about-those-companies-that-buy-houses" target="_blank">
            one of the nation's most
            recognizable home buyers
          </a>, according to the US News. </p>
        <p>We prefer a simple and straightforward process. We always <a href="home-buyers-still-open" target="_blank">visit in person</a> and look at your home before we
          make an offer. We buy houses in almost any condition. Since 2014, home sellers have trusted our fair cash
          offers. </p>
        <p>Would you make an offer on a home you’ve never even seen? Of course not. So why should you trust someone who
          would? We buy houses we’ve seen and don’t give offers on houses we haven’t.
